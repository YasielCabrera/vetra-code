# Architecture

> For maintainers. Using Vetra Code? See [docs/user](../user/).

Vetra Code is a server runtime that owns agent sessions, workspaces, and version control, plus web
and desktop clients that talk to it over one authenticated Effect RPC WebSocket. The server is the
execution boundary: every provider process, terminal, git operation, and filesystem read happens
there, never in the client.

```

The [RPC contract](../../packages/contracts/src/rpc.ts) is the boundary between independently
versioned clients and servers. Subscriptions send the state a client needs, so a client viewing one
thread does not pay for every thread's history. Authentication of a socket does not authorize every
method on it. See [environment auth](./environment-auth.md).

Provider-specific behavior belongs behind an adapter. Orchestration works with normalized commands
and events, so adding a provider should not require branches throughout the domain or clients.
See [provider constraints](./providers.md).

## Durable intent and side effects

The event log is the source of truth for orchestration state. The
[engine](../../apps/server/src/orchestration/Layers/OrchestrationEngine.ts) serializes commands;
the [decider](../../apps/server/src/orchestration/decider.ts) produces events without performing
provider or filesystem work. Events, persisted projections, and the accepted command receipt commit
in one database transaction. The in-memory state changes and subscribers receive events after that
commit. This keeps command retries idempotent and prevents a persisted projection from getting
ahead of the event log.

Reactors perform side effects after intent has been recorded, then feed results back through
commands. A command acknowledgement therefore means the intent committed, not that the provider,
checkpoint, or other follow-up work finished. Keep external I/O out of the decider and the database
transaction.

`packages/client-runtime` holds every non-visual client concern: connection lifecycle,
authentication, RPC, cached environment data, and domain state as Atom factories. The web renderer
uses it directly and the desktop app hosts that renderer. React components never construct transports, retry loops,
or RPC clients. See [connection-runtime.md](./connection-runtime.md).

## Turn completion and checkpoints

A turn ending and its follow-up work settling are separate milestones. The
[projector](../../apps/server/src/orchestration/projector.ts) settles the turn from its session
status. A late checkpoint or diff must not extend the recorded turn duration or keep the client
showing provider work as active.

[Checkpoints](../../apps/server/src/checkpointing/CheckpointStore.ts) use hidden Git refs to
capture workspace state without adding commits to the user's branch. A revert must coordinate
workspace state with the provider conversation. A provider that cannot roll back its conversation
must reject that operation before changing the filesystem.

## Waiting for asynchronous work

Tests use [drainable workers](../../packages/shared/src/DrainableWorker.ts) to wait until both the
queue and its current item have finished. An empty queue alone does not prove the worker is idle.

Runtime receipts mark specific test milestones. Their
[production layer](../../apps/server/src/orchestration/Layers/RuntimeReceiptBus.ts) is a no-op;
production behavior must use persisted state and events. These test signals are separate from the
durable command receipts that make dispatch idempotent.

See the [glossary](./glossary.md) for shared terms and the
[development runbook](../operations/development.md) for setup and checks.
