# Updating Vetra Code

The app you use and the server running your agents can be on different machines.
When a server is behind your web or desktop app, an update notice appears in the
conversation and **Settings → Connections**. Update the machine named in that
notice.

## Before you update

Server updates restart the connection and can interrupt active agents and
terminal commands. Saved threads, settings, and project files remain.

**Settings → General → Continue threads after restarts** is off by default.
Enable it to resume supported active threads after an update, crash, or machine
restart. Changes are saved to connected environments that support this setting;
update older servers first. If a supported environment was offline or has a
different value, use **Apply to all** in Settings after it connects.
Vetra Code must start again on that machine;
the setting does not enable automatic startup. Terminal commands may still be
interrupted, and threads without saved provider resume state need a new message.
If you previously enabled continuation for updates, enable this setting once
to allow recovery without a connected client.

Updates from the previous orchestration system preserve conversation transcripts but cannot carry
every kind of runtime history forward. Read [Threads from older Vetra Code versions](./thread-migration.md)
before continuing an important older thread.

## When versions don't match

A client and server must speak the same orchestration protocol. If they do not, the connection is
refused rather than running half-upgraded:

- An app newer than the server is blocked before connecting, with a notice telling you to update
  Vetra Code on the machine named in the notice.
- A server newer than your app refuses the connection with an update message.

Update the side the notice names, then reconnect.

## Update a connected server

Vetra Code does not publish server releases yet, so the offered update actions
cannot install a new version. Rebuild the server from its checkout instead.

On the host, run:

```sh
git pull && pnpm install && pnpm build:desktop
```

Then restart the desktop app if it hosts the server. For a server you started by hand,
stop it and start it again afterwards with your usual options such as `--host`
or `--tailscale-serve`.

## Update providers

**Settings → Providers** shows provider updates for the selected environment.
**Update all** updates every outdated provider on every connected environment
at once. Hover it to see which providers it will update. Providers that only
offer a manual update command are not included.
