# Codex

Use your ChatGPT plan or an existing Codex CLI login to code in Vetra Code.

## Connect with ChatGPT

Connect during onboarding or in **Settings → Providers**. For a remote machine,
select that environment first. Vetra Code handles Codex installation; sign in on
OpenAI and allow sharing of your ChatGPT plan.

Manage shared usage and credits in ChatGPT through **Manage usage** in Vetra Code.
If a request uses a feature that ChatGPT sharing does not support, use another
provider for that request.

When reconnecting, choose the same account in Vetra Code and on OpenAI's sign-in
page. Disconnecting stops running threads but keeps their history and lets you
reconnect later.

If remote sign-in cannot return automatically, paste the full URL from the final
localhost page into the sign-in panel, even if that page could not load.

## Use an existing Codex login

Vetra Code can use your installed Codex and its existing login. Run `codex login`
on the environment's machine to sign in. [Provider setup](./install.md#providers)
covers installation and custom configuration.

## Use multiple accounts

Add another ChatGPT account in **Settings → Providers**, then select the account
from the thread's model picker. Compatible accounts can continue the same thread.
Connecting accounts through Vetra Code leaves your CLI login unchanged.

### Multiple CLI logins

A shared Codex home with a shadow home lets work and personal accounts continue
the same threads. The accounts share Codex sessions and configuration while keeping
their own login and available models.

Keep your first account in `~/.codex`. On the environment's machine, sign the
second account into a fresh directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.codex_personal
CODEX_HOME=~/.codex_personal codex login
```

Then add a second Codex instance in **Settings > Providers**:

In an existing Codex thread, send `/feedback` or `/feedback` followed by a description of the
issue. Vetra Code uploads the thread and Codex logs to OpenAI and shows a thread ID that you can copy
and share with OpenAI employees.

## Answer questions while Codex works

Codex can ask a question and keep working. Answer it in the thread's question
panel. The answer becomes a new message: it reaches the active turn, or starts
another turn if Codex has finished. Unanswered questions survive reconnects.
If you do not want to answer, dismiss the question from its panel. Dismissing
closes it without sending anything to Codex. This requires a Codex version that
supports async questions.

## Approve app access

Codex tools can request access to another app. Respond to the named app's request
in the thread on web, desktop, or mobile. Some tools offer access for one request,
the current session, or permanently. See [Permission modes](./permission-modes.md)
for command and file approvals.

The web and desktop Agents panel shows each sub-agent's model and reasoning effort when Codex
reports them. If Codex does not report either value, Vetra Code leaves it out instead of using the
parent agent's settings.

## Codex says I hit a usage limit

When Codex stops on a usage limit, the thread names the window that ran out and when it resets, when
Codex reports them. Send the message again after the reset. On a workspace plan the message also
says whether your workspace owner needs to add credits or raise the spend limit to continue sooner.

## Browser and computer activity

Browser and Computer Use calls show their user-facing task title when Codex provides one. Expanded
activity groups show an icon for every call. Website calls use the active page's favicon when it is
available, and desktop app calls use the app's native icon on macOS when available. Other hosts use
a generic fallback glyph.

Collapsed activity groups are summarized by source, such as `Used Chrome integration`, instead of
showing the underlying tool name. Website favicons and native app icons keep their original colors;
integrations that provide separate light and dark logos use the logo for the current appearance.

## Approve access to other apps

When a Codex tool needs access to an app such as Safari, Vetra Code shows the app name and asks for
approval. You can approve, decline, or cancel the request from the desktop app, web app, or mobile
app. Some tools also offer approval for the current session or permanent approval.

## I Want Work And Personal Codex Accounts

Use one real Codex home and one shadow home.

Recommended setup:

```text
~/.codex      shared Codex home
~/.codex_p    second account auth
```

The idea is:

- both accounts can see the same Vetra/Codex sessions
- each account keeps its own login
- existing threads can continue with either account

### Set Up The First Account

Log in normally:

```bash
codex login
```

This is the account used by `~/.codex`.

In Vetra Code Settings, name it something obvious:

```text
Display name: Codex Work
CODEX_HOME path: ~/.codex
Shadow home path: empty
```

### Set Up The Second Account

Log in with a separate Codex home:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.codex_p
CODEX_HOME=~/.codex_p codex login
```

In Vetra Code Settings, add another Codex provider:

```text
Display name: Codex Personal
CODEX_HOME path: ~/.codex
Shadow home path: ~/.codex_p
```

The important part is that both providers use the same `CODEX_HOME path`, but only the second one
has a `Shadow home path`.

## Which Account Am I Using?

Open Settings and look at the provider row.

Vetra Code shows the authenticated email for providers that report one. Emails are blurred by default;
click the blurred email to reveal it.

Use display names and accent colors to make accounts easy to tell apart in the model picker.

## I Need A Different API Key Or Endpoint

Use the provider's Environment variables section in Settings.

This is useful when a Codex-compatible setup needs account-specific variables. Add the variables to
the provider instance that should receive them, and mark API keys or tokens as sensitive. Sensitive
values are stored as server secrets and are not sent back to the app after saving.

## Can I Switch Accounts In An Existing Thread?

Yes, when both Codex providers share the same `CODEX_HOME path`.

For example:

```text
Codex Work      CODEX_HOME path: ~/.codex
Codex Personal  CODEX_HOME path: ~/.codex, Shadow home path: ~/.codex_p
```

Those two providers are considered compatible for continuation, so the locked model picker can show
both.

If you add a third Codex provider with a completely different `CODEX_HOME path`, Vetra Code treats it
as a different workspace. It will not be offered for existing threads created under `~/.codex`.

## If Both Accounts Look The Same

If two Codex providers show the same account or the same unexpected model list:

1. Check the email in Settings.
2. Refresh provider status.
3. Confirm the second provider has `Shadow home path` set.
4. Confirm the shadow directory has its own `auth.json`.
5. If you copied `~/.codex` into the shadow directory, remove everything except `auth.json`.

Example cleanup:

```bash
find ~/.codex_p -mindepth 1 ! -name auth.json -exec rm -rf {} +
```

## When To Use A Separate CODEX_HOME

Use a totally separate `CODEX_HOME path` only when you want a separate Codex workspace.

That means separate sessions and less account switching inside old threads. Most dual-account users
should use the shared-home plus shadow-home setup instead.
